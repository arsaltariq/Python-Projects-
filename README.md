# Spider-Dice-Game-Project-

The goal is to draw a spider. Each player rolls one dice at a time, if they roll a 6, they draw the body of the spider(). Once they have drawn the body- if they roll a 3 or 4, they can draw a leg, or a 1 to draw an eye. Their score is how many rolls are required to complete the spider, however they must draw the body first.
